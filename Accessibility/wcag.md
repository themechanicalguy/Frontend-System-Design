# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for Accessibility

- The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), provide recommendations to make web content accessible to people with disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological impairments.
- WCAG is a global standard for web accessibility.

## Core Principles

WCAG is organized around four principles, summarized by the acronym **POUR**:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable in ways users can perceive.
   - Examples: Text alternatives for images (alt text), captions for videos, adaptable content for screen readers.
2. **Operable**: User interface and navigation must be operable by all users.
   - Examples: Keyboard accessibility, sufficient interaction time, avoiding seizure-causing content.
3. **Understandable**: Information and user interface must be clear and understandable.
   - Examples: Simple language, predictable navigation, input error assistance.
4. **Robust**: Content must work reliably across various user agents, including assistive technologies.
   - Examples: Valid HTML, compatibility with current and future tools.

## Levels of Conformance

WCAG defines three levels of compliance:

- **Level A**: Basic accessibility requirements; minimal but incomplete accessibility.
- **Level AA**: Addresses common barriers; widely targeted for compliance (e.g., by governments).
- **Level AAA**: Highest accessibility level; broader needs but harder to achieve universally.

## Key Guidelines and Success Criteria

WCAG 2.1 (current as of May 2025) includes 13 guidelines under POUR, with 78 testable **success criteria**. Examples include:

- **Text Alternatives (1.1)**: Provide alt text for non-text content.
- **Time-based Media (1.2)**: Offer captions, audio descriptions, or transcripts for multimedia.
- **Adaptable (1.3)**: Support multiple presentation formats (e.g., for screen readers).
- **Distinguishable (1.4)**: Ensure visibility and audibility (e.g., color contrast, resizable text).
- **Keyboard Accessible (2.1)**: Enable full keyboard functionality.
- **Enough Time (2.2)**: Allow sufficient time for interaction.
- **Seizures and Physical Reactions (2.3)**: Avoid content causing seizures or discomfort.
- **Navigable (2.4)**: Provide clear navigation (e.g., descriptive links, focus indicators).
- **Input Modalities (2.5)**: Support diverse inputs (e.g., touch, voice).
- **Readable (3.1)**: Ensure text is readable and understandable.
- **Predictable (3.2)**: Maintain consistent operation of web pages.
- **Input Assistance (3.3)**: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
- **Compatible (4.1)**: Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies.

## Versions

- **WCAG 2.0 (2008)**: Foundational standard, still widely used.
- **WCAG 2.1 (2018)**: Extends 2.0 with criteria for mobile, low vision, and cognitive accessibility.
- **WCAG 2.2 (2023)**: Adds criteria like focus appearance and dragging movements.
- **WCAG 3.0 (in development)**: Draft version with a flexible, user-centric approach (not yet standard).

## Practical Applications

- **Legal Compliance**: Referenced in laws like U.S. Section 508 and EU EN 301 549 (often Level AA).
- **Design and Development**: Guides developers, designers, and content creators for inclusive digital content.
- **Testing and Evaluation**: Tools like WAVE or Axe use WCAG for accessibility audits.

## Benefits

- **Inclusivity**: Supports 15-20% of the global population with disabilities.
- **Broader Reach**: Enhances usability for all, including mobile users or those with temporary impairments.
- **SEO and Usability**: Aligns with search engine optimization and user experience best practices.
